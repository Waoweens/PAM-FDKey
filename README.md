# PAM-FDKey

> [!CAUTION]
> this project is in the early stages and is not ready for use AT ALL.

use a flash drive as a key for your computer

this comes in 2 parts: the PAM module and the daemon

the reason why there's a daemon, is because i am really bad at C

PRs to rewrite everything in C are welcome \:3

## Warning

this is not secure, do not use this for high security applications

i am using this to keep people out of my computer whilst not having to type an extremely long password.
